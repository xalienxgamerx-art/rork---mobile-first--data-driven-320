/**
 * Building roadmap Phase 1A — semantic layer over [BuildingDef].
 *
 * This file adds *meaning* to buildings; it does not change how they are built, rendered,
 * collided or simulated. Three ideas:
 *
 *  1. [BuildingTaxonomy] — the closed vocabularies (classifications, functional zones, access
 *     levels), the legacy `BuildingDef.type` → classification mapping, and the generated
 *     room-purpose → zone mapping. Unknown words never guess; they resolve to "" and are
 *     reported by [ContentBuilder].
 *  2. [LogicalBuilding] — one stable logical identity per building, with TES-style derived
 *     instance references for its exterior ("ext:<id>") and future interior ("int:<id>").
 *     These are properties computed from the id, not persistent data: nothing here loads an
 *     interior yet.
 *  3. [BuildingDirectory] — resolves a building id to its [LogicalBuilding] with [RoomMeta]
 *     rooms. Procedural buildings derive rooms from their generated floor plans (floor-qualified
 *     refs, so the same local room number on different floors cannot collide); hand-authored
 *     buildings use the rooms their pack declares. Legacy buildings with no metadata get none —
 *     no rooms are ever fabricated.
 *
 * Everything is deterministic and derived from content + the (cached, seeded) generator, so
 * saves stay at their current version with no migration.
